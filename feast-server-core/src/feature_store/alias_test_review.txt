• Bug crops up when the request’s entity map happens to yield driver_id before truck_id. The builder in 
GetOnlineFeatureResponse::try_from assumes that any features are appended before we advance to the
  next entity column, but driver_id has no matching rows for the alias service. When we call next_entity the code resets 
  current_entity_idx to next_feature_idx, whose value is still 1. That causes the
  next entity (truck_id) to reuse index 1—the slot intended for the first feature—and the initial feature 
  (often acc_rate) writes into the truck_id column rather than creating its own entry. You can see
  the problematic coupling between entity-slot advancement and feature-slot tracking in 
  feast-server-core/src/feature_store/response_builder.rs:196-339 and, in particular, next_entity at :284-287.

  Because Rust’s HashMap iteration order is randomized, sometimes truck_id is handled first (everything passes) and
   sometimes driver_id goes first (we drop the acc_rate column), which explains the
  flakiness.

  A robust fix is to decouple entity positioning from next_feature_idx. For example, keep a separate counter for entity columns or 
  bump current_entity_idx += 1 in next_entity and only let
  next_feature_idx track true feature slots. Alternatively, sort the entity keys before iterating so truck_id is processed 
  first, but adjusting the builder logic will address the underlying indexing bug.

  Repro: cargo test get_features_alias -- --nocapture. Next steps: update next_entity/add_feature_value so entity entries don’t reuse feature slots, then rerun the test suite.
